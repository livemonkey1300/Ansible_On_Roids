<h1>Ansible On Roids</h1>
<strong>Status:</strong> Was dump into GIT required time to build properly

<h2>Note:</h2><br>
Most of those playbook where originally hooked to a Django Web UI , that was one off my project <br>
If it's not order or not documented or confusing it's because it doesn't have it's database to run the script<br>
<br>
In the future i'm planning to rebuild the Web UI, with a better one than my original project<br>
<br>
